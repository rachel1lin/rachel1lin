              <h4>Background </h4>
              I was a college student not too long ago trying to figure out how to make food. I read recipes, bought ingredients,
              and tried my hand at making good food. Sometimes it was successful; sometimes it wasn’t. While learning more about
              conversation design, I thought this situation made for a fascinating VUI challenge, where users are multi-tasking,
              busy with their hands, and in need of a flow of information.

              <h4> Understanding the User </h4>
              <h2> First sample dialog + WOz prototyping </h2>
              <span>I first wrote a <a href="https://www.notion.so/Dialog-1-WOz-prototyping-d0e20379aa1541c6aa9778ce24bd3461">sample dialog</a>
              to understand how users might interact with a voice assistant while cooking. I tried it out while a friend and I cooked mandu, a Korean-style dumpling.
              I looked for places of friction and pain points
              to tackle in my next script. I quickly found out many of the assumptions I made were wrong and I missed a lot of things, but I
              learned a lot in the process. Failure is a great teacher.</span>

              <h2> User interviews </h2>
              I interviewed 5 college students and recent grads on how they approach using recipes to cook. I chose college students because they
              are often in a phase of life where they are cooking for themselves for the first time in their lives. Some quickly became expert chefs
              and some continue to struggle to cook a decent dish. (I'm in the latter group.)
            </div>

            <div class="case">
              <h4> Insights </h4>
              <h2> From interviews </h2>
              <ul>
                <li> Learning to cook can be a visual task, especially when following along Youtube videos. This would pose a challenge to
                design voice-first. </li>
                <li> Users are cautious of food waste and enjoy social cooking </li>
                <li> Users have to scroll their devices to read recipes and cook at the same time </li>
                <li> Users value efficiency and don’t want to take too long to cook </li>
              </ul>

              <h2> Personas </h2>
              From the research, I created two personas from patterns that I saw within the users. The two personas have two
              different needs; thus, I needed to design for both ends.

            <div class="case">
            <h4> Example flows </h4>
            The standard flow is ideal for the basic chef walking through each step of the recipe. It's not enforced that users have to follow this flow and thus,
            advanced chefs can use the voice assistant questions about specific ingredients at any time. Users can also ask for a list of ingredients.
