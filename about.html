            Hiya, I’m Rachel! I’m a senior at UC Berkeley, studying Cognitive Science
            and minoring in Political Economy. CogSci and Polecon span a multitude of disciplines,
            ranging from linguistics to neuroscience to political science, and that pretty
            much sums up how I couldn't decide on just one thing to study.<br><br>

            My favorite takeaways from school have been about the big-picture systems and operations in which
            our society works, particularly in psychology and business.
            Thereafter, I found my path in human-centered design. Design has versatile applications,
            draws knowledge from every corner of the world, and aims to simplify the complexity of everyday life.
            As a designer and soon-to-be grad, I am excited to continue learning about different people from different spaces, meanwhile
            working towards solving some of their problems.

            <br><br>

            I also like browsing urbanist memes, collecting cool t-shirts and popping
            runny egg yolks. Beep me if you wanna reach me!
