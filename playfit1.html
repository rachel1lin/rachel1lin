          <h1>Playfit x BI pt. 1</h1><h2>Fall 2018</h2>
          <h3>Foundational research project with design consulting club</h3>
          <div class="case"><br>

            The design process is hardly ever linear and this project is no exception.
            Our task since its conception has diverged into multiple channels from gamifying
            the fitness motivation experience to a social media platform. I have divided our
            multi-faceted process into two parts: (1) fitness motivation game and (2)
            fitness app onboarding.<br><br>
            This page is the fitness motivation game, which includes:<br>
            ðŸ‘‰ A run-through of the highlights of our research<br>
            ðŸ‘‰ Synthesis of data collected <br>
            ðŸ‘‰ Ideation - and an elaboration on my part <br><br>

            <!--<h4>CONTEXT </h4>
            According to our client, the target user was someone with (1) a desire to get
            fit (2) perhaps have a fitness routine in mind or in place (3) and struggle
            to keep the motivation. <br> <br>-->

            <h4>PRIMARY RESEARCH + INSIGHTS</h4>
            We crafted a screener survey and selected 11 participants to interview.
            Our questions encompassed fitness habits and mobile preferences. In our larger survey, we surveyed 93 participants. <br><br>
            - Many were initially motivated by body image to become fit but continued because they felt healthier and stronger.<br>
            - The main barriers to working out were time management, distance from gym, lack of motivation,
            and lack of sleep and energy <br>
            - Half had consistent routines; half did not. Our target audence is the half that do not.<br><br>
            - 72% have started a routine and stopped in the past year <br>
            - 57% have an issue staying motivated <br><br>

            <h4>SECONDARY RESEARCH</h4>
            Because gaming has a complex psychology behind it, we sought seccondary research on current trends and expert opinions.<br>
            - Users are more motivated to work out when they have a positive self-perception,
            have healthy competition, and enjoy their workout. <br>
            - Users are more likely to play fitness games when playing against friends.<br>
            - Users enjoy using Youtube as a source of fitness videos because there is less
            chance of social anxiety, they are accessible, and Youtubers are engaging and
            empowering.<br><br>

            <h4>RESEARCH ANALYSIS </h4>
            My team got together and affinity mapped our research findings. Though unsure of
            where to start, we came up with some common themes and began ideating for our original
            game task. <br><br>

            Multiple barriers to fitness motivation <br>
            - Time, fatigue, inexperience â†’ Pain points that come with prioritizing fitness <br>
            - Predictability, accountability, fitness as a consequence â†’ Ways to motivate <br>
            - Social facilitation, recognizing intrinsic motivation, entertainment ability â†’ Desired game features<br>

            <img src="analysis.png" alt="synthesis of research">

            <h4>PROBLEM STATEMENT</h4>

            <h2> How might we utilize mobile gaming and its social and entertainment components to help college students
              stay motivated to their fitness routine? </h2><br><br>

            <h4>IDEATION</h4>
            Following our research analysis, each person on our four-person team came up with a game idea. <br><br>

            I did some extra secondary research into Gen Zâ€™s usage of apps. Their attitude towards games
            was to combat boredom and they felt towards lifestyle apps created efficiency. Thus, I knew
            the game had to balance both somehow. After considering all the research, I believed the game
            should birth a cycle of motivation using boredom and efficiency. <br><br>

            Get bored â†’ Play game â†’ A desire for free power-ups fuels motivation to exercise â†’ Earn power-ups â†’ Play more <br><br>

            I came up with Protein Crush, which is essentially Candy Crush but instead of candy items,
            it would be healthy items e.g. bananas, weights, running shoes, etc. Instead of money or wait
            time as currency, users will earn power-ups through achieving fitness goals. The game is
            known to be addicting and in its own way, motivating, which solves users' problem of lack of motivation. At the time, Candy Crush was the #1
            Grossing Game in Play Store, #15 in Arcade, and #39 in iTunes store. <br><br>

            Still being inspired by Candy Crush, I thought that a Facebook integration would promote
            social facilitation and healthy competition. For example, users can send power-ups to each
            other to encourage friends that are inactive!<br><br>
              <img src="playfit-sketch.jpg" alt="sketch of candy crush idea">
            <h4> IN RETROSPECT </h4>
            We presented the four ideas to our client and let them choose which one they liked the most. Looking back,
            this might not have been the best way to choose our next steps. Each of our proposed solutions had their own strengths
            and weaknesses in solving the problem, so I would display a bar graph for each solution that showed how well each
            one solved the pain points listed in the research. Then, we could more efficiently observe the feasability of solving some pain points over others, and
            our client can more easily prioritize which of them are more important, as it is difficult to solve for all of them
            equally.
