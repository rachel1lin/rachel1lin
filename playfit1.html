          <h4> Background </h4>
            This project was my first in the club, and my teammates were all new members.
            (Typically, a team is comprised of 2 returning and 2 new members.) It was a
            challenge to navigate such an exploratory, open-ended project, but ultimately, I'm proud
            of our teamwork and how much we persevered at such a steep learning curve.
            <br><br>
            The design process is hardly ever linear and this project is no exception.
            This case study explores the twists and turns we experienced over the course
            of the semester.
          </div>
            <!--<h4>CONTEXT </h4>
            According to our client, the target user was someone with (1) a desire to get
            fit (2) perhaps have a fitness routine in mind or in place (3) and struggle
            to keep the motivation. <br> <br>-->
        <div class="case">
          <h4>Client Vision </h4>
            Backed by a social good venture fund, our client envisioned a mobile app game that
            would motivate fitness and consistency in its users. They requested our club's help to conduct
            some preliminary research and explore potential designs to get them started.
            <h2> User Problem </h2>
            <div class="row-container opportunities">
              <div class="rectangle"></div>
              Users want to get fit and struggle with consistency and motivation.
            </div>
            <h2> Opportunity </h2>
            <div class="row-container opportunities">
              <div class="rectangle"></div>
              Create a game that will track and encourage users to continue keeping active.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="case">
          <h4> Research </h4>
          Within our limited amount of time and resources, we approached our tasks with efficiency.
          I pushed to get as many responses as possible in order to see more accurate trends.
          Due to our direct access to students on campus, we constrained the user base
          to our community of college students and collected as much data as we could.

          <h2>Fitness Habits</h2>
            Below, we have the aggregated data from 11 user interviews and 93 survey respondents.
            <br><br>
            <ul>
              <li>Fitness motivation is successfully sustained by feelings of newly gained health and strength</li>
              <li>Main barriers to working out are time management, distance from gym, lack of motivation,
                  and lack of sleep and energy </li>
              <li>Half of participants did not have consistent routines </li>
              <li>72% have started a routine and stopped in the past year </li>
              <li>57% have an issue staying motivated </li>
            </ul>
            <br>

            <h2>Gaming + Fitness = ?</h2>
            Because fitness and gaming has a complex psychology behind it, we sought seccondary research on current
            trends and expert opinions.
            <br><br>
            <ul>
              <li>Users are more motivated to work out when they have a positive self-perception,
              have healthy competition, and enjoy their workout. </li>
              <li>Users are more likely to play mobile fitness games when playing against friends.</li>
              <li>Users enjoy using Youtube as a source of fitness videos because there is less
              chance of social anxiety, they are accessible, and Youtubers are engaging and
              empowering.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4> Role as Sprint Leader </h4>
            Our club structures its projects in 4 sprints, where each team member takes on a leadership role for each sprint.
            I led Sprint 2 for ideation, which lasted two weeks and covered Research Analysis and Game Ideation. Here were some
            of the tasks I completed:
            <br><br>
            <ul>
              <li> Created an agenda and slide deck for every team and client meeting</li>
              <li> Put together the critique deck for review by other club members</li>
              <li> Set deadlines and sent reminders before each one </li>
              <li> Led ideation and had everyone bring in one flushed out idea for a total of 4 ideas </li>
              <li> Organized our notes and slides in Google Drive </li>
              <li> Led affinity mapping workshop and research analysis</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div class="case">
            <h4>Research Analysis </h4>
            I gathered up the team and suggested we affinity map our findings so that we could all be on
            the same page and have a holisitic understanding of our user. We each filled out post-its,
            worked together to find patterns, and grouped insights under a couple of themes:
            <br><br>
            <div class="opportunities">
              <u>Most salient pain points</u>
              <ul>

                <li>Fatigue</li>
                <li>Inexperience</li>
              </ul>
              <u>Best ways to motivate</u>
              <ul>
                <li>Predictable regimen</li>
                <li>Being held to accountability</li>
                <li>Fitness as a secondhand consequence</li>

              <ul>
                <li>Social facilitation</li>
                <li>Recognizing intrinsic motivation</li>

            After research, we honed our problem scope some more to focus the game more on socialability and

            <h4>Game Ideation</h4>

            <h2>More Secondary Research</h2>
            When we split off to ideate, I did some extra secondary research into Gen Z’s usage of apps. I learned they felt games
            combatted boredom and lifestyle apps were a vessel for maximizing their efficiency.
            In my opinion, this was a crucial piece of information to work with, so I created a hypothesis that propogated
            this cycle of motivation through balancing this equation of boredom and efficiency. <br><br>
            <img src="playfit_cycle.png" alt="psychological hypothesis"><br>
            <h6>A prediction of user behavior and interaction with game</h6>
            <br>
            <h2> The Idea </h2>
            I came up with Protein Crush, which is similar to Candy Crush. Instead of real candy,
            the game icons can be healthy items e.g. bananas, weights, running shoes, etc. Instead of money or wait
            time as currency, users earn power-ups through achieving fitness goals. Fitness data taken into the app would be translated into power-ups
            that help the user crush more and advance through the game.
            The idea weighs heavily on integration with Facebook in order to promote
            social facilitation and healthy competition. One way to do this would be to let users send power-ups to each
            other to encourage friends that are inactive.
            <br> <br>
            Other ideas by my creative teammates include Tinder for gym buddies, scientifc visualizations of how fitness
            impacts the body, avatar sports, and Yelp/4square for fitness and health.

          <!---  <h4> IN RETROSPECT </h4>
            We presented the four ideas to our client and let them choose which one they liked the most. Looking back,
            this might not have been the best way to choose our next steps. Each of our proposed solutions had their own strengths
            and weaknesses in solving the problem, so I would display a bar graph for each solution that showed how well each
            one solved the pain points listed in the research. Then, we could more efficiently observe the feasability of solving some pain points over others, and
            our client can more easily prioritize which of them are more important, as it is difficult to solve for all of them
            equally. --->
          <div class="case">
            <h4> Changing the Deliverable </h4>
            We realized we did not have the capacity to design and build a mobile game, but
            one design challenge we could tackle was the game's onboarding, where the purpose and intent
            of the game is introduced and absorbed by the user. Because we wanted to design for
            users to have a positive and healthy mentality towards fitness, as users oftentimes
            don't when it comes to their bodies, it was vital to communicate and be transparent.
            Users wanted predictablity in a mobile fitness game, and onboarding was one way we could deliver that.
            It was especially crucial to inform users of how their data was used in the game.
            <br><br>
            It is also important to note that the game became abstract concept instead of one of our concrete game ideas.
          </div>
            <!--- Our team’s process was to diverge on our own and later converge as a team.
            Explicit onboarding would translate data literally into the game e.g. steps taken
            would equate to speed level. I vouched for implicit onboarding, which would translate
            data into game power-ups e.g. steps taken would equate to a banana power-up. I felt
            this would make fitness motivation more subtle and “trick” users into making fitness fun. <br><br>

            Our client decided on explicit onboarding because it seems less complex and more
            straighforward. It’s also a good starting framework. --->

        <div class="case">
            <h4>Ideating for Onboarding</h4>
            Here, we split off and sketched out ideas. My team then converged to highlight and number the screens
            that we thought worked best for the onboarding process. <br><br>
            Visually illustrations most easily communicates the process of how the data collected is integrated
            into the game, so I sketched a cat wearing an Apple Watch, walking, sweating, and earning bonuses.

            <h4>Concept Testing</h4>
            Using a mid-fidelity prototype, we tested these concepts on 6 users and took note of users' perceptions.
            <br><br>
            <h2> Feedback + Iteration </h2>
            <ul>
              <li><b><h3>Human avatar vs. animal avatar</b></h3></li>
              We received negative feedback on human avatars that physically reflected users' body changes and more
              positive feedback towards the animal avatar. We switched over to letting the user choose which animal
              they wanted to be while still giving the user some flexibility in customizing their animal avatar.
              <br><br>
              <li><b><h3>Effectiveness of onboarding in explaining how the user's data is integrated</b></h3></li>
              Users were confused about how the fitness data was used, so our next iteration of designs
              were more explicit and had 3 screens of visuals and text to explain the data integration.
              <br><br>
              <li><b><h3>Attitude towards social and competitive gameplay</b></h3></li>
              Users were generally pleased and/or excited about involving their friends in their fitness journey. Many
              said they would feel motivated or accountable.
              <br><br>
              <li><b><h3>General interest in product</b></h3></li>
              Our testers showed some positive interest in the app but definitely had their questions and reservations
              about certain aspects. We aimed to address those in our next iteration.
            </ul>
            Below is the mid-fidelity prototype, we used for the first round of testing:
        </div>

      <div class="page-container">
        <div class="case">
          <h4> Designing for mental health </h4>
              One of our client's request for the game was to have an avatar that reflected the weight and physical changes
              of the user's body. The idea behind it was that it would be more motivating and potent to the user and
              drive them towards getting more fit. Thinking that that might be too potent for some users, we suggested
              an animal avatar that emoted to postively reward the user for their accomplishments. We decided to
              test it out on a couple of users and get their feedback.
              <br><br>
              For one, I predicted that the animal avatar would help users project insecurities less because it was not a literal reflection of themselves. Secondly,
              my hope was that users would believe this avatar was more of a pet that needed to be walked
              than a body to be changed. Within our concept testing, users commented that the cat was "cute".
              This leads to the conjecture that users did not see the cat as themselves but can still project the emotion of caring onto it,
              which makes for a healthier avatar reflection of the user.
        </div>
        <div class="case">
          <h4>More User Testing </h4>
          While our deadline was approaching, we squeezed in one more round of user testing and interviewed 9 users.
          With the updates from the concept testing, this time we tested for usability and conducted A/B testing on some
          visual illustrations.
          <br><br>
          <h2> Feedback + Iteration </h2>
          <ul>
            <li><h3><b> Users want to be able to skip connecting their health data from the Apple Watch or Apple Health Data</b></h3> </li>
            The game's purpose is best fulfilled with health data, so we did not add a skip button. However, with the dotted pagination,
            users may be able to figure out that a skip is possible by swiping left.
            <br><br>
            <li><h3><b> Having both the user's name and a name for the avatar was confusing </b></h3></li>
             We consolidated both into one username, so users have the flexibility to name as they usually do (e.g. Uroborus143 v. rachel1lin).
             <br><br>
            <li><h3><b> Mixed feedback on the avatar - "childish" vs. "very cute" </b></h3></li>
            This could be a matter of how the avatar is illustrated. We left the cat avatar as a placeholder for now and left the graphic design up to the future iterations.
            <br><br>
            <li><h3><b> Order of the tutorial confused users until they saw the aggregated stats page </b></h3></li>
            We moved the aggregated stats page in front of the individual stats pages so that the user could get a big picture first and then specifics.
            <br><br>
            <li><h3><b> Many users are taking a long time to understand or still misinterpreting how the health data is translated, even with explicit text </b></h3></li>
            Perhaps it is not enough to see static images and text. In future explorations, I would like to try out how animations can communicate
            to the user. Games tend to use more dyamic designs in order to convey more complexity.
            <br><br>
            <li><h3><b> Users prefer seeing the stats bar rather than the stats icons because it is easier to read </b></h3></li>
            In our final design, we used the stats bar.

          <h4>Project Pivot: Social Media </h4>
            In a last-minute exploration, our client wanted us to delve further into our research about ‘social facilitation’
            and asked us to explore a social media for fitness. This was exciting to me, so I created two screens, a news feed and group chat. <br><br>

            <h2> News Feed </h2>
            The newsfeed would show activities from friends or any influencer/celebrities that use the app, similar to Twitter.
            People can post anything related to fitness, such as healthy recipes and practicing a form of self-care. Ideally,
            this is a space where people can feel encouraged and safe about caring for their mind and bodies. Social interactions
            are facilitated through “claps”, which I took inspiration from Medium.  Claps are positive and reinforcing reactions and
            can be pressed multiple times to express enthusiasm.  If a person has been inactive for a while, users can send “waves”
            to check in on friends that might need a morale boost or check-in. <br><br>

            <h2> Groups </h2>
            Groups are more private and purposefully selected by the user to encourage a stronger protection on data privacy,
            especially since we’re dealing with personal health data. In the Groups page, users can group their exercise buddies
            and chat to set up plans, motivate each other, and see each other’s progress.

            <h4> In Retrospect </h4>
            Since this was my first project within Berkeley Innovation, I realize I have grown a lot as a designer since then.
            Some things I learned and would add or change:
            <br><br>
            <ul>
              <li> For this project, we chose the user base based on what was most accessible to us and our client's
                interest in this generation's technological familairity. I think it would have been nice to consider
                older demographics as another persona because mobile gaming is very common amongst older crowds.</li>
              <li> The importance of onboarding was a really significant and surprising learning point for me, for which I am grateful
                for this project. I continue to carry knowledge from this project to my work today. The entire experience
                challenged my team and me, but this first consulting project for us is a monumental stepping stone
                for us and our design paths.</li>
              <li> I wish I could have balanced how we measured the success of our designs. Our qualitative method also worked well
                to give us a holistic understanding of user needs, but it would also be nice to have some quantitative data to balance it out.
                For example, we could have timed the amount of time it took for users to feel like they understand the onboarding info during the
                first and second rounds of user testing. Then, we could compare the times so we could see if the design changes were effective. </li>
            </ul>

          // When the user scrolls the page, execute myFunction
      window.onscroll = function() {myFunction()};

      function myFunction() {
        var winScroll = document.body.scrollTop || document.documentElement.scrollTop;
        var height = document.documentElement.scrollHeight - document.documentElement.clientHeight;
        var scrolled = (winScroll / height) * 100;
        document.getElementById("myBar").style.width = scrolled + "%";
      }

      var btn = $('#btp-button');

      $(window).scroll(function() {
        if ($(window).scrollTop() > 300) {
          btn.addClass('show');
        } else {
          btn.removeClass('show');
        }
      });

      btn.on('click', function(e) {
        e.preventDefault();
        $('html, body').animate({scrollTop:0}, '300');
      });
