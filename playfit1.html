            This project was my first in the club, and my teammates were all new members.
            (Typically, a team is comprised of 2 returning and 2 new members.) It was a
            challenge to navigate such an exploratory, open-ended project, but ultimately, I'm proud
            of our teamwork and how much we persevered at such a steep learning curve.<br><br>

            The design process is hardly ever linear and this project is no exception.
            This case study explores the twists and turns we experienced over the course
            of the semester.
            <br><br>

            <!--<h4>CONTEXT </h4>
            According to our client, the target user was someone with (1) a desire to get
            fit (2) perhaps have a fitness routine in mind or in place (3) and struggle
            to keep the motivation. <br> <br>-->

            <h4>Client Vision </h4>
            <br>
            Backed by a social good venture fund, our client envisioned a mobile app game that
            would motivate fitness and consistency in its users. They requested our club's help to conduct research
            and explore potential designs.

            <br><br>

            <h4>Primary Research: Fitness Habits</h4>
            <h3> <i> Interviews: 11 | Survey respondents: 93</i> </h3>
            Because of the broad scope of the project, we constrained the user base
            to college students, which was one of the demographics the client wanted to target.
            As undergraduates, it was convenient that that was our most accessible and immediate network
            to recruit users for research.
            <br><br>

            <ul>
              <li> Fitness motivation is successfully sustained by feelings of newly gained health and strength</li>
              <li>Main barriers to working out are time management, distance from gym, lack of motivation,
                  and lack of sleep and energy </li>
              <li>Half of participants did not have consistent routines </li>
              <li> 72% have started a routine and stopped in the past year </li>
              <li> 57% have an issue staying motivated </li>
            </ul><br>

            <h4>Secondary Reserach</h4>
            Because fitness and gaming has a complex psychology behind it, we sought seccondary research on current trends and expert opinions.
            <br><br>
            <ul>
              <li>Users are more motivated to work out when they have a positive self-perception,
              have healthy competition, and enjoy their workout. </li>
              <li>Users are more likely to play mobile fitness games when playing against friends.</li>
              <li>Users enjoy using Youtube as a source of fitness videos because there is less
              chance of social anxiety, they are accessible, and Youtubers are engaging and
              empowering.</li>
            </ul><br>

            <h4>Research Analysis </h4>
            My team got together and affinity mapped our research findings. We
            found patterns and grouped insights under a couple of themes and
            sought to ideate for a game that would fulfill these insights. Our analysis allowed
            priorize and narrow down our process.<br><br>

            <b><center> Time, fatigue, inexperience → <br>Most salient pain points to be addressed <br><br>
            Predictability, accountability, fitness as a consequence → <br> Best ways to motivate <br><br>
            Social facilitation, recognizing intrinsic motivation, entertainment ability → <br> Key and necessary characteristics<br><br>
          </b> </center>
          <div class="case-img">
            <img src="analysis.png" alt="synthesis of research">
          </div>
          <br>
            With the research, my team formulized a problem statement to help us focus our design choices.
            <br>
            <div class="problem-container">
              <div class="problem"></div>
              <div class = "problem-statement"> How might we utilize mobile gaming and its social and entertainment components to help college students
                stay motivated to their fitness routine?
              </div>
              </div>
              <br>


            <h4>Ideation</h4>
            Following our research analysis, each person on our four-person team came up with a game idea. <br><br>

            I did some extra secondary research into Gen Z’s usage of apps. Their attitude towards games
            was to combat boredom and they felt towards lifestyle apps created efficiency. Thus, I knew
            the game had to balance both somehow. After considering all the research, I believed the game
            should birth a cycle of motivation using boredom and efficiency. <br><br>

            <center> Get bored → Play game → A desire for free power-ups fuels motivation to exercise → Earn power-ups → Play more <br><br>
            </center>
            I came up with Protein Crush, which is essentially Candy Crush but instead of candy items,
            it would be healthy items e.g. bananas, weights, running shoes, etc. Instead of money or wait
            time as currency, users will earn power-ups through achieving fitness goals. The game is
            known to be addicting and in its own way, motivating, which solves users' problem of lack of motivation. At the time, Candy Crush was the #1
            Grossing Game in Play Store, #15 in Arcade, and #39 in iTunes store. <br><br>

            Still being inspired by Candy Crush, I thought that a Facebook integration would promote
            social facilitation and healthy competition. For example, users can send power-ups to each
            other to encourage friends that are inactive!<br><br>
            <div class="case-img">
              <img src="playfit-sketch.jpg" alt="sketch of candy crush idea">
            </div>


          <!---  <h4> IN RETROSPECT </h4>
            We presented the four ideas to our client and let them choose which one they liked the most. Looking back,
            this might not have been the best way to choose our next steps. Each of our proposed solutions had their own strengths
            and weaknesses in solving the problem, so I would display a bar graph for each solution that showed how well each
            one solved the pain points listed in the research. Then, we could more efficiently observe the feasability of solving some pain points over others, and
            our client can more easily prioritize which of them are more important, as it is difficult to solve for all of them
            equally. --->
            <h4> Solidifying the Deliverable </h4>
            Originally, our deliverable was up in the air, but after ideation, we decided to
            deliver the game's onboarding. The onboarding was arguably the most important design challenge, where
            the purpose of the app was made clear to the user. Properly communicating
            how the fitness data and game worked together was vital to informing transparency to users.<br> <br>

            <!--- Our team’s process was to diverge on our own and later converge as a team.
            Explicit onboarding would translate data literally into the game e.g. steps taken
            would equate to speed level. I vouched for implicit onboarding, which would translate
            data into game power-ups e.g. steps taken would equate to a banana power-up. I felt
            this would make fitness motivation more subtle and “trick” users into making fitness fun. <br><br>

            Our client decided on explicit onboarding because it seems less complex and more
            straighforward. It’s also a good starting framework. --->

            <h4>Lo-fidelity prototype</h4>
            <br>
            Here, we split off and sketched out ideas and came together to highlight and number the screens
            that we thought worked best for the onboarding process. <br><br>
            <div class="case-img">
              <img src="lo1.png" alt="lo-fidelity sketch">
              <img src="lo2.png" alt="lo-fidelity sketch">
            </div>

            <br><h4>Mid-fidelity prototype</h4>
            <br>
            After some concept testing and iteration, we settled on this basic framework. We envisioned the
            avatar as animals or pets in order to present progress and other health insights without infringing on
            one's perception of self-image. <br><br>
            <div class="case-img">
              <img src="hi.png" alt="hi-fidelity">
            </div>

            <br><h4>Project Pivot: Social Media </h4>
            <br>
            In one last exploration, our client wanted us to delve further into our research about ‘social facilitation’
            and asked us to explore a social media for fitness. Because I was brimming with ideas, I created the left two screens, a news feed and group chat. <br><br>

            The newsfeed would show activities from friends or any influencer/celebrities that use the app, similar to Twitter.
            People can post anything related to fitness, such as healthy recipes and practicing a form of self-care. Ideally,
            this is a space where people can feel encouraged and safe about caring for their mind and bodies. Social interactions
            are facilitated through “claps”, which I took inspiration from Medium.  Claps are positive and reinforcing reactions and
            can be pressed multiple times to express enthusiasm.  If a person has been inactive for a while, users can send “waves”
            to check in on friends that might need a morale boost or check-in. <br><br>

            Groups are more private and purposefully selected by the user to encourage a stronger protection on data privacy,
            especially since we’re dealing with personal health data. In the Groups page, users can group their exercise buddies
            and chat to set up plans, motivate each other, and see each other’s progress. <br><br>
            <div class="case-img">
              <img src="socialmedia.png" alt="hi-fidelity">
            </div>

            <br><h4> In Retrospect </h4>
            <br>
            For this project, we chose the user base based on what was most accessible to us and our client's
            interest in this generation's technological familairity. I think it would have been nice to consider
            older demographics as another persona because mobile gaming is very common amongst older crowds.
            <br><br>
            The importance of onboarding was a really significant and surprising learning point for me, for which I am grateful
            for this project. I continue to carry knowledge from this project to my work today. The entire experience
            challenged my team and me, but this first consulting project for us is a monumental stepping stone
            for us and our design paths.
