            <h4> Background </h4>
            During the spring semester of my senior year, I joined a team of student designers in a contracted design
            project in the healthcare industry. Of course, COVID-19 struck mid-way through the semester,
            resulting in a transition to remote work, which called for some improvising and adapting.
           </div>

           <div class="case">
             <h4> The Ask </h4>
             According to our client, the mobile app is centrally a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and mindfulness training program.
             Our job was to conduct research into how this experience should look and how the mobile app can best serve.
             <br><br>
             Going into our first client meeting, we had a vague idea of what Fahed and Steve envisioned for this product
             and over time, gradually whittled down our ice block into a scuplture. Here is where we started out:

             <h2> User Problem </h2>
             No app or community for solving chronic pain with alternative medicine and users are at a loss as to what to do
             next

             <h2> Opportunity </h2>
             Build a welcoming community and source of information to empower chronic pain patients
           </div>

           <div class="case">
             <h4> Interactive Prototype </h4>
             Check out my team's hi-fidelity prototype on Figma! Continue reading below for the case study with a focus on
             my portion of the project: health tracking and insights.

            <h4> Understanding Users with Chronic Pain </h4>

            <h2> User Interviews </h2>
              We found 5 users across the U.S. with Rheumatoid Arthritis and other chronic conditions through a user research recruiting platform.
              We prepared an interview guide and set up video calls to get to know more about how their condition(s) affect their daily life,
              perception of alternative medicine and mindfulness, etc.
              <br><br>
              Here are some pain points and other insights to help understand the user and how they live with chronic conditions:
              <br><br>
              <ul>
                <li> There is a lot of fear and/or anxiety around flare-ups. Stress and weather are common triggers. </li>
                <br>
                <li> Many users continuously do extensive research about their condition and different treatments. They deeply read journal articles,
                  scientific research, and medical websites. </li>
                <br>
                <li> Online communities, like Facebook groups and subreddits, are places where they can listen to first-hand experiences and
                  receive true empathy. Sometimes family members do not truly understand what they are going through. </li>
                <br>
                <li> Most users think practicing mindfulness is for depression and anxiety and are not aware of how it can be applied to chronic pain.</li>
                <br>
                <li> Users are forced to adapt their lifestyle to their condition and largely choose to stay at home,
                  where they can control their environment. </li>
                <br>
                <li> Since CBD is not legal on a federal level and access is limited in some states, some users were apprehensive towards it as an alternative medicine, but
                  some are willing to try anything that will help. </li>
                <br>
              </ul>

            <h2> Literature </h2>
            Because the goal of the app is to approach health holistically, my team also did the same in our research.
            We consulted some design research and methods to learn how to build technology that truly takes care of its users.
            <br><br>
            <ul>
              <li> Here are a couple of ways to design for mindfulness that guided my thoughts as I designed:
                value human attention, discourage addictive usage, and minimize social anxiety.
              <a href="https://www.designingmindfulness.com/">Source</a></li>
              <br>
              <li>“Patients preferred easy tap user interfaces to multitap or slider methods, and vertical question layout...
              Patients liked to be engaged by progress feedback reports and educational tips...found a trended outcome summary
              report helpful which provides more precise details on whether and how the symptoms are changing over time.”
              <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5994956/">Source</a></li>
              <br>
              <li> “The progress line charts were also thought to work well as they show “a trend of symptoms over time-getting better or worse.”
              Participants also liked to see comparative data, such as month to month, “my knee pain in this month is better than last month.”
              And some participants would like the app to be able to drill down to specific data points and allow users to add notes to provide a
              better understanding of the circumstances that lead to major fluctuations."
              <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5994956/">Source</a></li>
              <br>
              <li>In an experiment co-designed by RA patients, users expected "(1) a calendar feature for goal setting, planning, and recording
                of physical activity performance and progress, and
                (2) a small community feature for positive feedback and support from peers."
              <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4342685/">Source</a></li>
            </ul>

            <h2> Competitive Analysis </h2>
            We looked at some of the top symptom management apps in the App store like Gali Health, Flo, Migraine Buddy, and Flaredown for
            inspiration.

            <h4> Framing the Problem </h4>
            With the new onslaught of knowledge, it was overwhelming how many directions we could go and designs we could explore.
            Thus, my team and I held a framing workshop with our client to clarify our deliverable and
            identify the scope of the mobile app.
            <br><br>
            While our problem statement still came out long and vague, this was an effective way to communicate in order for both parties
            to be on the same page. Through this framing workshop, we were able to better meld client expectations and user needs
            discovered through our research.
            <br><br>
            <h2> User Problem (Reframed)</h3>
            <div class="row-container">
              <div class="rectangle"></div>
              <div class="problem-statement">
                How might we create <u>a supportive, empathetic, realistic but optimistic environment [for patients] that pairs education with community</u>
                to guide chronic pain patients through the ups and downs of their condition?
              </div>
            </div>


          </div>


          <div class="case">
            <h4> Ideation </h4>
            As a team, we invited our clients to brainstorm with us a list of interactions that helped to address pain points
            found in our the research. Then, we grouped them by common denominators.

            <img src="mayv_features.png">
            <h6> List of possible features that could be in the app</h6>
            <br><br>
            This was an awesome list of interactions to put together into a mobile app, but we still lacked direction in our
            design process. After diverging on so many ideas, we needed to re-center our thought process around the user.
          </div>

          <div class="case">
            <h4> Planning </h4>
            <!--Where there is hesitancy to approach alternative medicine, we saw an opportunity to build something around that
            that was welcoming and friendly in order to encourage users to further
            pursue community and knowledge. Users tended to be very well-read in their conditions and we wanted this app to make their journey of discovery and
            experimentation easier.-->
            My team and I created this more specific problem map to encompass all of the user's different needs and take into account
            multiple perspectives of our overarching problem. We then grouped all the opportunities and divided them into different features of the mobile app.
            This analysis method allowed us to prioritize which features and interactions to design for the minimum viable product.
            I've underlined the opportunities for my group: the Health Tracking feature.

          <div class="case">
            <h4> Health Tracking </h4>
            Because I was in charge of Health Tracking, I began working on the calendar view and symptom tracking designs.
            Below are the early iterations.
            <br<br>
            <h2> Calendar View </h2>
            Because there is a lot of fear and anxiety about flare-ups,
            I chose to start with a weekly view in order for users to see the days leading up to
            flare-up. Users would be able to easily sort through each day they logged their symptoms and
            draw their own inferences from the data.

            <h2> Symptom Logging </h2>
            Users preferred easy tap user interfaces over writing in their symptoms, so I designed buttons with
            suggested words. If a word was not there, users had the option of customizing their own. Users liked to be
            aware of their progress, so I chose to design a sliding
            progress chart within symptom logging so that users could compare the feeling of today against the feelings of the days prior.
            Because users prefer not to slide, the chart can also be tapped.
            <br><br>
