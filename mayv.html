            <h4> Background </h4>
            <span> I contracted and joined a team of designers in an early-stage healthcare start-up,
            where my client saw that patients with chronic pain exhausted all known chronic pain solutions and are at a loss as to what to do.
            Their solution was to build a mobile app to host a <b>mindfulness training program, inclusive community, and other resources</b>
            while also introducing patients to alternative medicine and CBD topicals.</span>

            <h4> Understanding Users with Chronic Pain </h4>
            <h2> User Interviews </h2>
              We found 5 users across the U.S. with Rheumatoid Arthritis and other chronic conditions through a user research recruiting platform.
              We prepared an interview guide and set up video calls to get to know more about how their condition(s) affect their daily life,
              perception of alternative medicine and mindfulness, etc.
              <br><br>
              Here are some pain points and other insights to help understand the user and how they live with chronic conditions:
              <br><br>
              <span><ul>
                <li> There is <b>a lot of fear and/or anxiety around flare-ups</b>. Stress and weather are common triggers. </li>
                <li> Many users continuously do extensive research about their condition and different treatments. They deeply read journal articles,
                  scientific research, and medical websites. <b>Knowledge is power over their condition.</b> </li>
                <li> Users expected the technology to <b>generate insights and tell them patterns or information</b> they might have missed. </li>
                <li> Online communities, like Facebook groups and subreddits, are places where they can listen to first-hand experiences and
                  receive true empathy. Sometimes family members do not truly understand what they are going through. </li>
                <li> Most users think practicing mindfulness is for depression and anxiety and are not aware of how it can be applied to chronic pain.</li>
                <li> Users are forced to adapt their lifestyle to their condition and largely choose to stay at home,
                  where they can control their environment. </li>
                <li> Since CBD is not legal on a federal level and access is limited in some states, some users were apprehensive towards it as an alternative medicine, but
                  some are willing to try anything that will help. </li>
              </ul></span>

            <h2> Literature </h2>
            Because the goal of the app is to approach health holistically, my team also did the same in our research.
            We consulted some design research and methods to learn how to build technology that truly takes care of its users.
            <br><br>
            <span><ul>
              <li> Here are a couple of ways to design for mindfulness that guided my thoughts as I designed:
                <b>value human attention, discourage addictive usage, and minimize social anxiety.</b>
              <a href="https://www.designingmindfulness.com/">Source</a></li>
              <li>“Patients preferred easy tap user interfaces to multitap or slider methods, and vertical question layout...
              Patients liked to be engaged by progress feedback reports and educational tips...found a trended outcome summary
              report helpful which provides more precise details on whether and how the symptoms are changing over time.”
              <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5994956/">Source</a></li>
              <li> “The progress line charts were also thought to work well as they show “a trend of symptoms over time-getting better or worse.”
              Participants also liked to see comparative data, such as month to month, “my knee pain in this month is better than last month.”
              And some participants would like the app to be able to drill down to specific data points and allow users to add notes to provide a
              better understanding of the circumstances that lead to major fluctuations."
              <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5994956/">Source</a></li>
              <li>In an experiment co-designed by RA patients, users expected "(1) a calendar feature for goal setting, planning, and recording
                of physical activity performance and progress, and
                (2) a small community feature for positive feedback and support from peers."
              <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4342685/">Source</a></li>
            </ul></span>

            <h2> Competitive Analysis </h2>
            We looked at some of the top symptom management apps in the App store like Gali Health, Flo, Migraine Buddy, and Flaredown for
            inspiration.

          <div class="case">
            <h4> Framing the Problem </h4>
            <span>With the new onslaught of knowledge, it was overwhelming how many directions we could go and designs we could explore.
            Thus, my team and I held <b>a framing workshop with our client to clarify our deliverable and
            identify the scope of the mobile app.</b></span>
            <br>
            While our problem statement still came out long and vague, this was an effective way to communicate in order for both parties
            to be on the same page. Through this framing workshop, we were able to better meld client expectations and user needs
            discovered through our research.
            <br><br>
            <h2> Problem Statement </h2>
            <div class="row-container opportunities">
              <div class="rectangle"></div>
                <span>How might we create <u>a supportive, empathetic, realistic but optimistic environment [for patients] that pairs education with community</u>
                to guide chronic pain patients through the ups and downs of their condition?</span>
            </div>
          </div>


          <div class="case">
            <h4> Initial Round of Ideation </h4>
            As a team, we invited our clients to brainstorm with us a list of interactions that helped to address pain points
            found in our the research. Then, we grouped them by common denominators.

            <img src="mayv_features.png">
            <h6> List of possible features that could be in the app</h6>
            <br><br>
            This was a great list of interactions to put together into a mobile app, but we still lacked direction in our
            design process. After diverging on so many ideas, we needed to re-center our thought process around the user.
          </div>

          <div class="case">
            <h4> Breaking the Problem Down </h4>
            <!--Where there is hesitancy to approach alternative medicine, we saw an opportunity to build something around that
            that was welcoming and friendly in order to encourage users to further
            pursue community and knowledge. Users tended to be very well-read in their conditions and we wanted this app to make their journey of discovery and
            experimentation easier.-->
            <span>My team and I created this more specific problem map to encompass all of the user's different needs and take into account
            multiple perspectives of our overarching problem. We then grouped all the opportunities and divided them into different features of the mobile app.
            This analysis method allowed us to <b>prioritize which features and interactions to design for the minimum viable product</b>.

            <h4> Health Tracking in Mid-fi</h4>
            Because I was in charge of Health Tracking, I began working on the calendar view and symptom tracking designs.
            Below are the early iterations.

            <h2> Calendar View </h2>
            <span>Because there is a lot of fear and anxiety about flare-ups,
            I chose to start with a weekly view in order for users to see the days leading up to
            flare-up. Users would be able to <b>easily sort through each day, week, or month</b> they logged their symptoms and
            draw their own inferences from the data.</span>

            <h2> Health Insights </h2>
            <span>Users preferred easy tap user interfaces over writing in their symptoms, so I designed buttons with
            suggested words. If a word was not there, users had the option of customizing their own. Users liked to be
            aware of their progress, so I chose to design <b>a sliding
            progress chart</b> within symptom logging so that users could <b>compare the feeling of today against the feelings of the days prior</b>.
            Because users prefer not to slide, the chart can also be tapped.</span>
            <br><br>

            <img src="mayv_midfi.png">
            <h6>Early iterations of calendar and symptom logging</h6>
          </div>

          <div class="case">
            <h4> Calendar in Hi-fi </h4>
            <span>Our style guide was led by another teammate with the rest of us coming together to bounce ideas off of each other
            and represent our features' interactions.
            We were given a font and colors to work with by the branding agency our client worked with. With those, we <b>expanded
            the style guide to adapt to a mobile app </b>(i.e. typography, hierarchy, spacing, etc). Then, I applied the style guide accordingly.
            <br><br>
            After multiple rounds of design critiques with my team lead and the clients, I made a handful of changes
            to the designs.</span>
            <br>
            <ul>
              <li> Removed the second dot on top on the calendar days. Was not clear that that
                stood for flare-ups.</li>
              <li> Added a month view because users want to see month-to-month progress as well. </li>
              <li> Split Health Logs and Insights into two separate sub-pages. Realized each sub-page was
              going to contain way more content. </li>
              <li> Then, experimented with sliding cards to quickly switch and increase visibility between
                days without tapping each day.</li>
              </ul>
              <br><br>

            <h4> Health Insights in Hi-fi </h4>
            <span>Since our goal was to create a comprehensive tool and resource for users with chronic conditions,
            I wanted to empower users to <b>compare their data and progress</b>. In our research, users were predominantly
            very meticulous about their tracking (i.e. wrote diaries, annotated calendars) or only tracked sometimes.
            The graph is pretty simple and will show the respective line when the x-axis option is selected below.
            Originally, I wanted to add AI-generated insights like many health apps do.
            One user's story particularly stood out to me - she stopped tracking because seeing a lack of progress
            was depressing. My intention for this tool was to <b>be more objective rather than encouraging</b>. Encouragement
            coming from the app can seem false when chronic conditions can be unpredictable. The graph can also
            be useful when users bring this tool to the doctor.</span>

            <h4> In Retrospect </h4>
            After the project ended upon graduation, I reflected on what went well, what could be improved, and what I learned.
            <br>
            <ul>
              <li> <b> Client communication </b> In terms of client communication, I feel that was one of our strengths of this project. Between every step,
                we met with our client through Zoom meetings and talked about our progress and next steps.
              <li> <b> Re-architecting </b> Would change the two-page slide between Health Logs and Insights. There is already a
                lot of sliding going on in the page. While the user can tap to switch between the pages, the
                bar is intended to indicate a sliding motion. I would either re-work the information architecture
              to have them as their own separate pages or if that was not possible, I would make Insights into a
            button on the top right corner. Every time a new insight was generated, the button can have a red notification
          bubble.  </li>
          <li> <b> Balancing feature creep and exploration</b>  Because we were in the first phases of building an MVP, I think
            it's great that we explored so many app features. We covered a lot of ground and the expansiveness of the project allowed for a lot of creativity.
            I would challenge us to agree upon less features and focus more on key experiences that users would use rather than simply benefit from.</li>
            <li> <b> Adding labels </b> In the insights graph, I chose not to label the y-axis because the attributes were mostly measured differently
            and I could leave it to the users to have learned the measurements through symptom logging. It can definitely be a little unclear so one idea to combat confusion
          is to allow users to click on a vertical and access the measurements in a pop-up box. </li>
