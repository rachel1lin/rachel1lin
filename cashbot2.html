          <h1>Cashbot.ai Landing Pages</h1><h2>Summer 2018</h2>
          <h3>Website redesign task for two types of customers</h3>
          <div class="case"><br>

            Cashbot.ai has two target audiences: chatbot creators and businesses.<br><br>

            Chatbots creators hold influence over a base of loyal users with specific
            interests making for an ideal yet untapped market. Cashbot.ai is the software
            solution for these creators to tailor native ads for their users and profit
            from every purchase. On the other hand, businesses looking to acquire customers
            can referred by these developers and access their engaged audience.<br><br>


            <h4>PROCESS </h4><br><br>
            My process for the overall feel and look for the pages started with the company's
            values, as discovered in a branding workshop our company did together. Our CEO
            pushed for irreverence, which I took as an opportunity to develop a light-hearted,
            clean website.  <br> <br>

            <h4>USER TESTING</h4><br>
            I tested the prototypes on various businesses in the Skydeck Accelerator,
            UC Berkeley’s partner investment fund. I wanted to know if the purpose of
            cashbot.ai was clear and if the design appealed to them. General feedback stated
            some of the copy was hard to understand, which was edited by other team members.<br><br>


            <br><h4>IN RETROSPECT</h4>
            Things I would fix/add: <br>
            - “Did you know?” looks too much like a button, and it isn’t clickable.
            I would either remove it or restructure the four pieces to fit in a box grid together.<br>
            - Animate the illustrations! <br>
            - Experiment with font size, weight, and color more.<br><br>
