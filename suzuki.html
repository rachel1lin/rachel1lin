              <h4>Background </h4>
              In partnership with Suzuki Motors, our Berkeley Innovation team conducted
              research about Gen Z car shopping habits to shape Suzuki’s strategy
              for re-entering the U.S. market and winning the international car
              scene. As technology progresses, so do shopping habits. Our final solution was to reach Gen Z
              through a chatbot that educated users and diverted consumer behavior
              towards the Suzuki online car catalogue.
              <br><br>
              Our final deliverables were a chatbot prototype
              made through Chatfuel and Facebook Messenger and a research brief to pass on to Suzuki executives.

              <h2> User Problem </h2>
              Future shopping habits are changing and Gen Z is adapting and adopting new ways to consume.
              <h2> Opportunity </h2>
              Build and test emerging technologies that cater towards Gen Z needs.

            <h4> Research </h4>
            I was the Sprint Leader in charge of leading research activities and data collection methods.
            <br><br>
            Because we were starting with an ambiguous ask, I wanted to use a variety of research methods
            to gauge Gen Z shopping habits. We first consulted secondary research for studies already
            done on Gen Z and for me, I knew very little about cars in general so this step was especially
            helpful for me. I also led my team in doing empathy practices, framing workshop, Qualtrics survey, and user interivews.
            This was an ambitious amount of research to be done so I extended our sprint to be longer than the typical 2 weeks.

          <h4> Insights </h4>
          Here are a handful of insights from our survey and interviews that led us to create a chatbot. We decided to focus
          on the car research portion of the buying experience due to feasibility and the prevalence of pain points there.
          <ul>
          <li>Respondents’ knowledge about cars is very varied, and knowledge is generally pretty low.</li>
          <li>62% of respondents do not know where to sell a car.</li>
          <li> 91% would choose to visit a dealership, 9% would buy a car online, and 0% would buy from a vending machine.</li>
          <li> 90% plan on buying a car in the future; 10% do not plan to buy a car.</li>
          <li>For those planning to buy a car, majority plan to buy it at age 22-26.</li>
          <li>Respondents prefer cars because they have full autonomy over where they can go, cars are more convenient, and public transportation is unreliable.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Dialogue Design</h4>
        The script was originally written without the limitations of Chatfuel and Facebook Messenger. I mainly wrote it
        thinking the NLP/AI was extremely powerful and could pick up keywords and reply accordingly. I made some adjustments in
        the final prototype. Below is a simple dialogue flow suited for Chatfuel.

      <h4>User Testing</h4>
      We asked 8 users to try out the chatbot flow and gave them the same prompt. I would consider the prototype
      successful if users could finish the given task, enjoyed using the product, and drew helpful information from it.
      Here are the insights from the user testing sessions:
