              <h4>Background </h4>
              In partnership with Suzuki Motors, our Berkeley Innovation team conducted
              research about Gen Z car shopping habits to shape Suzuki’s strategy
              for re-entering the U.S. market and winning the international car
              scene. As technology progresses, so do shopping habits. Our final solution was to reach Gen Z
              through a chatbot that educated users and diverted consumer behavior
              towards the Suzuki online car catalogue.
              <br><br>
              Our final deliverables were a chatbot prototype
              made through Chatfuel and Facebook Messenger and a research brief to pass on to Suzuki executives.
              <br><br>
              <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3CF7INucHo">chatbot prototype</a></li>

              </ul>

              <h2> User Problem </h2>
              Future shopping habits are changing and Gen Z is adapting and adopting new ways to consume.
              <h2> Opportunity </h2>
              Build and test emerging technologies that cater towards Gen Z needs.
            </div>

            <h4> Research </h4>
            I was the Sprint Leader in charge of leading research activities and data collection methods.
            <br><br>
            Because we were starting with an ambiguous ask, I wanted to use a variety of research methods
            to gauge Gen Z shopping habits. We first consulted secondary research for studies already
            done on Gen Z and for me, I knew very little about cars in general so this step was especially
            helpful for me. I also led my team in doing empathy practices, framing workshop, Qualtrics survey, and user interivews.
            This was an ambitious amount of research to be done so I extended our sprint to be longer than the typical 2 weeks.
          </div>

        <div class="case">
          <h4> Insights </h4>
          Here are a handful of insights from our survey and interviews that led us to create a chatbot. We decided to focus
          on the car research portion of the buying experience due to feasibility and the prevalence of pain points there.
          <ul>
          <li>Respondents’ knowledge about cars is very varied, and knowledge is generally pretty low.</li>
          <li>62% of respondents do not know where to sell a car.</li>
          <li> 91% would choose to visit a dealership, 9% would buy a car online, and 0% would buy from a vending machine.</li>
          <li> 90% plan on buying a car in the future; 10% do not plan to buy a car.</li>
          <li>For those planning to buy a car, majority plan to buy it at age 22-26.</li>
          <li>Respondents prefer cars because they have full autonomy over where they can go, cars are more convenient, and public transportation is unreliable.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="case">
        <h4>Sample Dialog</h4>
        The script was originally written without the limitations of Chatfuel and Facebook Messenger.
        I made adjustments in the final prototype.
        <h2> Challenges/Limitations </h2>
        <ul>
          <li> No obvious way to go back to the original or previous prompt besides to scroll up.</li>
          <li> Limited interactions. No in-between of carousel (too large) and chips (too small). Wish there were more types of carousels or multi-option displays</li>
        </ul>

        <br>
        Below is an example dialog flow made for Chatfuel that I used for the prototype and user testing.

  <div class="set-width">
    <div class="page-container">
      <div class="case">
      <h4>User Testing</h4>
      We asked 8 users to try out the chatbot flow and gave them the same prompt. I would consider the prototype
      successful if users could finish the given task, enjoyed using the product, and drew helpful information from it.
      Here are the insights from the user testing sessions:
      <ul>
        <li> Suzi's casual tone was generally positively received. Most found her to be reliable and trustworthy though
          one user felt the opposite. </li>
        <li> Some users felt Suzi offered the same information they could find through Google. They would
          prefer if the chatbot could craft a more tailored response.
          </li>
        <li> Users were initially unfamiliar with chatbots, but quickly became comfortable with the chatbot
          format and encountered few usability issues.</li>
        </ul>
          </div>


        <div class="case">
          <h4>In Retrospect</h4>
          <ul>
            <li> The dialog tested moves linearly like a conversation, which worked as users were only
              given one flow to go through. However, my concern is how users will continue to discover content. If users
              do not rely on typing in questions and instead use the given buttons to navigate, then users
              will encounter more friction scrolling up to find the prompt they're looking for. Ideally, we would
              not use Chatfuel and design our own. </li>
            <li> I'd like to explore more of how this chatbot delivers information.
              I would design it so it gives a couple of bite-size information messages and allows the user to react in between
              instead of how it is now, where it seems very one-sided but has potential for more personality. So far, the prototype
            is functional but not social. </li>
            <li> Another feature I found helpful through Facebook Messenger chatbots was when the chatbot would send me
              daily or weekly notifications of car facts and opportunities to learn more. I would like to add that to the
              onboarding portion of the chatbot and allow users to choose how often they wanted notifications. </li>
            </ul>
