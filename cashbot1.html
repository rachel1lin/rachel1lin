          <h1>Cashbot.ai Creator Experience</h1><h2>Summer 2018</h2>
          <h3>Visual design for customer-facing experience</h3>
          <div class="case"><br>

            This was my first UI/UX design internship! My summer consisted mostly of visual design with the
            opportunity to shadow and contribute to information archeticture decisions.
            I worked within a team to produce hi-fidelity screens for the chatbot
            creator experience. Due to the fast-paced nature of the start-up, the
            screens went straight to development, skipping prototyping. <br><br>

            <h4> ABOUT THE CHATBOT INTEGRATION </H4>
            First, a chatbot needs to be created. Any topic works,
            so in this case, itâ€™s a chatbot that gives dental hygiene advice. Then, the chatbot
            creator goes to cashbot.ai and sets up an agent, which is an e-commerce store
            (e.g. Amazon, Shopify) and its product offerings. Then, the creator can train the
            agent by optimizing the data set and choosing the relevant products. Perhaps,
            toothpaste is more appealing to crowds than dentures? When the agent is implemented,
            products are suggested to the chatbot user and every click-through purchase results
            in profit for the creator and naturally, the e-commerce store.  <br><br>

            <h4> MY CONTRIBUTION </H4>
            Given the information architecture, my co-intern and I decided on the visual scheme.
            To be consistent with the cashbot.ai brand, we took the existing colors and selected just the
            green to signify the start-up's budding potential and allude to cash. <br><br>

            When it came to displaying the products, I suggested a grid view in addition to
            the list view. The list view was good for editing captions and titles, but I wanted another
            view that worked for those who wanted to rapidly choose products and use a default title. <br><br>

            I also made the loading screen graphics. I styled it similarly to the existing cashbot.ai logo.

            <br><br>

            <h4> IN RETROSPECT </H4>
            Looking back, I think the green would fare better as color reserved for action items i.e. buttons.
            I would remove the green and replace it with grey because it distracts from the product offerings. The product offerings
            will be a myriad of colors and should rightfully attract attention to themselves, so that the
            user's eye is focused on the task at hand: filtering products.

            A year after I look at this project, I feel this experience could be improved with a
            dashboard design. There are merits to boxing each piece of content, especially when it comes
            to organization, but it resulted in a lot of pages to walk through. I can foresee this being
            a pain point for users if they were to return to this experience to edit something.
