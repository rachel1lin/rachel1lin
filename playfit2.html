          <div class="case"><br>

            The design process is hardly ever linear and this project is no exception.
            Our task since its conception has diverged into multiple channels from gamifying
            the fitness motivation experience to a social media platform. I have divided our
            multi-faceted process into two parts: (1) fitness motivation game and (2)
            fitness app onboarding.<br><br>
            This page is the fitness app onboarding, which includes:<br>
            üëâ Overall, a foundational framework for a seed-stage start-up app<br>
            üëâ Visual exploration of onboarding process <br>
            üëâ Another pivot into social media<br><br>

            <h4>IDEATION </h4><br><br>
            After much discussion, our client and my team decided to work on the
            onboarding process rather than the game itself. Then, we could communicate
            how the fitness data and game worked together to the user.<br> <br>

            Our team‚Äôs process was to diverge on our own and later converge as a team.
            Explicit onboarding would translate data literally into the game e.g. steps taken
            would equate to speed level. I vouched for implicit onboarding, which would translate
            data into game power-ups e.g. steps taken would equate to a banana power-up. I felt
            this would make fitness motivation more subtle and ‚Äútrick‚Äù users into making fitness fun. <br><br>

            Our client decided on explicit onboarding because it seems less complex and more
            straighforward. It‚Äôs also a good starting framework. <br><br>

            <h4>LO-FIDELITY PROTOTYPE</h4><br>
            Here, we split off and sketched out ideas and came together to highlight and number the screens
            that we thought worked best for the onboarding process.<br><br>

            <img src="lo2.png" alt="lo-fidelity sketch">

            <br><h4>MID-FIDELITY PROTOTYPE</h4>
            After multiple rounds of user testing and reiteration, we settled on a basic framework that compromised
            the client‚Äôs requests for an avatar and our research. <br><br>

            <h4>FINAL PRESENTATION</h4>
            We chose a orange and blue color palette for our final deliverable and presented
            this concept to our client. <br><br>

            <br><h4>DIVERGENCE: SOCIAL MEDIA </h4>
            While we referenced our research and brought up ‚Äòsocial facilitation‚Äô multiple times to back our design choices,
            the client became interested in looking into fitness motivation through a combined social media platform and the
            original gamification intent. I created the left two screens, a news feed and group chat. <br><br>

            The newsfeed would show activities from friends or any influencer/celebrities that use the app, similar to Twitter.
            People can post anything related to fitness, such as healthy recipes and practicing a form of self-care. Ideally,
            this is a space where people can feel encouraged and safe about caring for their mind and bodies. Social interactions
            are facilitated through ‚Äúclaps‚Äù, which I took inspiration from Medium.  Claps are positive and reinforcing reactions and
            can be pressed multiple times to express enthusiasm.  If a person has been inactive for a while, users can send ‚Äúwaves‚Äù
            to check in on friends that might need a morale boost or check-in. <br><br>

            Groups are more private and purposefully selected by the user to encourage a stronger protection on data privacy,
            especially since we‚Äôre dealing with personal health data. In the Groups page, users can group their exercise buddies
            and chat to set up plans, motivate each other, and see each other‚Äôs progress. <br><br>
