          <h1>Cisco</h1><h2>Summer 2019</h2>
          <h3>Designed a mobile app version of the Customer Portal</h3>
          <div class="case"><br>
            When I joined Cisco the summer of 2019, the Cisco Customer Experience (CX) Team was working on
            a new product called the Customer Portal (CP). The CP is a CRM application that consolidates and organizes
            onboarding, troubleshooting, and educational resources
            for all Cisco products. The CP provides a step-by-step guide for all Cisco products and filters the relevant
            resources (PDFs, webinars, license training, etc.) for each step. It allows clients to
            proactively prevent problems instead of retroactively scrambling to fix, say, a network crash.
            This was the solution to clients struggling with Cisco’s antiquated search
            function to troubleshoot problems and inefficient usage of support cases.


            <br><br> My task for the summer was to design a mobile app for the CP.
            <br><br><br>
            <h4>NEEDFINDING</h4>

            I, along with members of the CX team, flew down to San Diego to attend the <i>Cisco Live!</i> conference
            and conducted user research with Cisco clients. Our main
            target audience was network engineers, who benefit the most from the CP and use the CP directly.
            <br><br>
            Main Interview Insights:
            <ul>
            <li>Network engineers are consistently on-the-go and often travel for work. </li>

            <li>Users expected the mobile app to notify them and provide the most pertinent information up
            front. </li>

            <li>Clients want better and quicker access to customer support. </li>
            </ul>
            <br><Br>

            <h4>PROBLEM</h4>
            Based off the research, I created this problem statement to help guide my process. <br><br>
            <h2> How might we expand our current web platform to mobile so we can improve network engineers' accessibility to the CP? </h2>
            <br><br><br>

            <h4>IDEATION</h4>
            My next task was to restructure this vast CRM tool into a compact mobile app.
            As part of my process, I sketched some navigation and interaction designs and wrote out all the possible user flows.
            Because the prototype of the CP did not yet have a homepage, I devised a home page that would allow users access
            to the most important highlights, as desired by users from the research.
            <br><br>
            Since there was a plethora of possible flows to explore, my collaborator and I each focused on
            flows that we felt were most useful to network engineers while tackling every section of the CP.
            My collaborator worked on Assets and Problem Resolution while I worked on the Home Page and Lifecycle.

            <br><br>

            <h4>PROTOTYPING </h4>
            I storyboarded the flow and included possible touch points where a network engineer will
            interact with his/her phone through a typical day. <br><br>

            Ned is a network engineer whose company has acquired a new site, and he is
            responsible for setting up its network. He wants to do a thorough job and knows
            that the CP will allow him to take preventative measures and maintain a healthy network.
            So begins his user journey with the CP. <br><br>

            The first thing he does is schedule a webinar from his laptop while at work to learn about setting
            up his product. Ned’s days are filled with meetings and collaboration, so he wants to take his
            learning outside the workplace. The scheduled webinar shows up in the app's home screen and from there,
            he watches the webinar on the commute to-and-from work, thanks to the portability of his mobile phone.
            <br><br>

              <div class="gif">
                <img src="schedule.gif"></div>
                <div class="text"> After Ned watches his scheduled webinar, he browses through
                the suggested resources. In order to drive further engagement after a video was watched,
                I added the "Suggested Resources" section, so that the user experience could cascade through more and more resources.
                While discovering more resources, the user can also schedule additional webinars.<br></div>
              </div>

            <div class="side-by-side">
              <div class="gif">
                <img src="highlights.gif"></div>
                <div class="text"> I designed a home screen page that allows for Ned
                to see the most important and relevant information right when he opens the app, a design decision driven by our research.
                I originally designed a drag-and-drop list to help users sort their priorities because users said they
                valued customizability in a mobile app, but this design would limit the amount of content that could be displayed.
                I decided to switch customizability for cleanliness and employed the Star filter, inspired by the Twitter and Gmail mobile apps.
                This method works well with a larger number of notifications and content can be more efficiently sorted with the Starred tab. <br>
              </div></div>

           <div class="side-by-side">
            <div class="gif">
              <img src="lifecycle.gif"></div>
              <div class="text">Coming back to the original story, Ned needs to go to the network site to set up his product.
              He uses his computer to pull up the command line interface but cannot access the instructions through his computer.
              He pulls out his phone and walks through the mobile app again to the Lifecycle page, where he finds the relevant PDF for setting up his product, as demo'd below.
              Ned successfully uses his phone and computer in parallel to efficiently and correctly set up his network hardware.
            </div> </div>

            <br><br><br>
            <h4>POSSIBLE NEXT STEPS</h4>
            If I could continue on this project, I would want to create a user testing guide to see if the designs accomplished the goal of making resources more
            accessible. I would measure its success by high click-through rates and time spent on each page.<br><br><br>

            <h4>NOTES</h4>
            Our reasoning from the research initially led us to believe that mobile notifications were the most important feature
            that the mobile CP could provide. One of our stakeholders pointed out that users could simply get an email about any
            important updates. I realized that just because users expected notifications, it didn’t mean that notifications would
            definitely bring any value to the user. Thus, I reevaluated our research and focused on the use case that highlighted
            the portability and convenience of a mobile app.<br><br>

            Another designer asked us if the CP could simply be opened in a web browser rather than a mobile app. My answer to that
            is that a mobile app allows for a better UI, especially because the web CP has so much information. A web browser has limited
            functionalities that would not allow for future AR and WebEx integrations and filtered home page. <br><br><br>
