          <h1>Cisco</h1><h2>Summer 2019</h2>
          <h3>Designed a mobile app version of the Customer Portal</h3>
          <div class="case"><br>
            When I joined Cisco this summer, the Cisco Customer Experience Team was working on
            the Customer Portal (CP),  an application that consolidates and organizes the resources
            for all Cisco products. Clients have struggled in using Ciscoâ€™s antiquated search
            function to troubleshoot problems, and opening a support case can be costly and inefficient.
            The CP provides a step-by-step guide for all Cisco products and filters the relevant
            resources (PDFs, webinars, license training, etc.) for each step. It allows clients to
            proactively prevent problems instead of retroactively scrambling to fix, say, a network crash.

            <br><br> My project involved validating and designing the mobile app version of the CP.
            <br><br><br>
            <h4>INTERVIEWS + INSIGHTS</h4> <br>

            Before we went to San Diego to conduct user research on clients, we wrote three high-level
            questions and then based our interview guide off of them. <br><br>

            ðŸ‘‰ Is the mobile application necessary?<br>
            Necessary may be too strong of a word in my opinion, but the mobile app could prove to
            be helpful in situations that require the portability of a phone, especially in an emergency.  <br><br>

            ðŸ‘‰ What needs and expectations must the mobile app have to increase stickiness with users?<br>
            Users expected the mobile app to notify them and provide the most pertinent information up
            front. <br><br>

            ðŸ‘‰ How will the transfer from web to mobile affect content and organization? What mobile
            interactions need to take place to fulfill the CPâ€™s value?<br>
            In terms of cutting portions of the CP, one of our stakeholders wanted to build
            everything out and cut later. We prioritized working on the screens that aligned with our insights.<br><br>
            <br><br><br>

            <h4>IDEATION</h4> <br>
            My ideation session consisted of looking at the web CPâ€™s interactive prototype, messily
            sketching some screen ideas (top half), and writing out all the possible tasks (bottom half).
            The web CP did not have a home page yet, so I sketched a possible home screen with click-through
            notifications and a hamburger menu for navigation. <br><br>

            There were a number of possible flows to explore, and we ambitiously wanted to do all of them.
            Instead of making a hundred screens, we crafted a user story that encapsulated the values of a
            mobile app and focused on two different user journeys, split between my collaborator and me. <br><br>

            My user journey involved the Home Page and Lifecycle features.

            <img src="cisco-ideation.jpg">

            <h4>USER JOURNEY + PROTOTYPING </h4><br>

            The user journey demonstrates the different touch points where an engineer will
            interact with his/her phone. <br><br>

            Ned is a network engineer whose company has acquired a new site, and he is
            responsible for setting up its network. He wants to do a thorough job and knows
            that the CP will allow him to take preventative measures and maintain a healthy network.
            So begins his user journey with the CP. <br><br>

            The first thing he does is schedule a webinar from his laptop while at work to learn about setting
            up his product. Nedâ€™s days are filled with meetings and collaboration, so he wants to take his
            learning outside the workplace. The scheduled webinar shows up in the app's home screen and from there,
            he watches the webinar on the commute to-and-from work, thanks to the portability of his mobile phone.<br><br>

            In this demo, Ned goes walks through the experience above (without watching the video) and browses through
            the suggested resources. My team wanted to further drive engagement after a video was watched in order for
            the app to bring more value to the user. Thus, I added the "Suggested Resources" section, so that the user
            experience could cascade through more and more resources. This demo includes the experience of scheduling another
            webinar.

            <img src="schedule.gif"><br>

            The web-based portal didn't have a home page, so I added an initial home screen page that allows for Ned
            to see the most important and relevant information right when he opens the app, a design decision driven by our research.
            I originally designed a drag-and-drop list to help users sort their priorities because users said they
            valued customizability in a mobile app, but this design would limit the amount of content that could be displayed.
            I decided to switch customizability for cleanliness and employed the Star filter, inspired by the Twitter and Gmail mobile apps.
            This method works well with a larger number of notifications and content can be more efficiently sorted with the Starred tab.

            <img src="highlights.gif"><br>

            Coming back to the original story, Ned needs to go to the network site to set up his product.
            He uses his computer to pull up the command line interface but needs the instructions. Luckily, he carries his phone with him wherever he goes.
            He goes through the mobile app again to the Lifecycle page, where he finds the relevant PDF for setting up his product, as demo'd below.
            Ned successfully uses his phone and computer in parallel to efficiently and correctly set up his network hardware.

            <img src="lifecycle.gif"><br>

            <h4>POSSIBLE NEXT STEPS</h4><br>
            While the Lifecycle pages are a translation from the current web CP prototype, the home page is a new endeavor.
            If I could continue on this project, I would want to do user testing on the home page to see what kind of
            format/functions users would prefer e.g. to-do list, drag-and-drop, deleting highlights, etc. <br><br>

            <h4>NOTES</h4><br>
            Our reasoning from the research initially led us to believe that mobile notifications were the most important feature
            that the mobile CP could provide. One of our stakeholders pointed out that users could simply get an email about any
            important updates. I realized that just because users expected notifications, it didnâ€™t mean that notifications would
            definitely bring any value to the user. Thus, I reevaluated our research and focused on the use case that highlighted
            the portability and convenience of a mobile app.<br><br>

            Another designer asked us if the CP could simply be opened in a web browser rather than a mobile app. My answer to that
            is that a mobile app allows for a better UI, especially because the web CP has so much information. A web browser has limited
            functionalities that would not allow for future AR and WebEx integrations and filtered home page. <br><br>
