          <h4>Background</h4>
          When I interned at Cisco during Summer 2019, their Customer Experience Team was working on the Customer Portal (CP),
          an application that consolidates and organizes Cisco product resources for clients.
          The CP provides a step-by-step repository of resources (i.e. PDFs, webinars,
          license training, etc.) for all of Cisco’s products.

          <h2> User Problem </h2>
          <div class="row-container opportunities">
            <div class="rectangle"></div>
            Cisco clients are frustrated with searching for and getting product support. Opening up a TAC case is costly and inefficient.
          </div>

          <h2> Opportunity </h2>
          <div class="row-container opportunities">
            <div class="rectangle"></div>
            Research, design, and prototype a mobile app to improve how clients consume product support.
          </div>
          Because the CP was an unreleased product at the time, it was necessary to collect preliminary data that would allow us
          to do some needfinding and discover the latent needs and opportunities where a mobile app can fill in gaps for the user.
          </div>

      <div class="case">
        <h4>Research</h4>
          Along with some members of the CX team, I flew down to San Diego to attend the Cisco Live!
          conference and conduct user research with Cisco clients.

          We conducted 12 user interviews to understand the work of network engineers and find any edge cases to account for.
          <h2> Method </h2>
          <div class="method-container">
            <ul>

          <h2> Insights </h2>
          We met users with varying job titles, from network architects to customer-facing consultants, and listened to their
          mobile usage experiences and expectations. The most abundant source were the network engineers who are the most
          attended job title at the conference. Knowing this, we decided our main
          target audience was the network engineers, who are predicted to engage the most with the CP
          due to their direct interactions with Cisco products.
          <br><br>
          Here are three main insights that helped me to anticipate the needs of users.

            <div><img src="insight3.png" alt="Clients want better and quicker access to customer support."></img></div>
          </div>

          With the insights from our research coupled with our given task, I devised this problem statement to focus our solutions.
          <div class="space"></div>
            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
            <div class="row-container opportunities">
              <div class="rectangle"></div>
                How might we expand our current web platform to mobile so we can improve network engineers' accessibility to the CP?

        </div>

        <div class="case">
            <h4>Planning</h4>
            I needed to restructure this vast CRM tool into a compact mobile app, so I first set out to lay out the barebones of the CP. I wrote
            out all the possible user flows and translated the navigation to be adapted to mobile. I also began exploring how to translating the
            web interactions into mobile interactions.

          <h6>How to prioritize tasks, how to navigate, how to re-architect the IA, and possible mobile tasks </h6>
        </div>
        <div class="case">
          There were a number of possible user flows to explore. My co-intern Helen and I divided our work up by features (I took Home Page and Lifecycle)
          and each crafted a user story that incorporated our research insights and communicated the value our solutions brought to the user.
          After considering the numerous flows and user needs, I constrained my project to focus on these key design opportunities.

            To better understand and explain user behaviors, I wrote a user journey detailing the day-to-day of a network engineer.
            This story incorporates the problem statement and showcases how a more accessible CP benefits
            the user, physically and within the app. The user journey also helped focus on which user flows were key.

            <h4> Design Solutions</h4>
            According to the user story, I anticipated these needs and chose three areas to tackle that would improve accessibility for the user:
            <br><br>
            <ul><h3>
              <li><b>Mobile navigation</b> - where users require access all the parts of the CP on their phone</li>
              <li><b>Resource discovery</b> - for users to further find more relevant information to supplement their learning </li>
              <li><b>Repository for the top highlights</b> - something users asked for and believed would bring them value</li>
            </h3></ul>
          </div>

          <div class="case">
            <h3><b> Mobile navigation</b> </h3>
            A universal search made sense given there were multiple categorical pages that users will switch between. It also
            eliminates the extraneous step of navigating to a specific category and then searching for the desired content.
            Next to the search button, I made space for a potential AR barcode scanner for extended search functionality.

            <h3><b> Resource discovery </b></h3>
            In order to have access to more relevant content and resources, I designed a “Suggested Resources” section underneath the
            video player that is visible when the phone is portrait mode until the phone is tilted into landscape mode for better video viewing.
            Through it, users can engage with more information and cascade through pages of additional content. I also added a kebab menu
            to each of content pieces for more actions, such as, queueing and sharing the content.
           <br><br>
            The section feature and kebab menu allow the user to have a more self-led and self-paced learning experience,
            which is ideal for their busy and convoluted schedules.

            Users expected a mobile app to be a simplified version of the web portal and wanted to have the most important information up front.
            I then explored three different formats and visual designs and weighed the pros and cons of each one.

            After the evolution of ideas, C seemed to be the most effective balance between making the
            content visually digestible for busy network engineers and bridging the look of the web and mobile interfaces together.
            <br><br>
            C was further iterated upon after I left my summer internship.

          <div class="case">
            <h4> Predicted Impact </h4>
            <img src="cisco_impact.png">
          </div>

          <div class="case">
            <h4>In Retrospect</h4>
            <!---Our reasoning from the research initially led us to believe that mobile notifications were the most important feature
            that the mobile CP could provide. One of our stakeholders pointed out that users could simply get an email about any
            important updates. I realized that just because users expected notifications, it didn’t mean that notifications would
            definitely bring any value to the user. Thus, I reevaluated our research and focused on the use case that highlighted
            the portability and convenience of a mobile app.<br><br>

            Another designer asked us if the CP could simply be opened in a web browser rather than a mobile app. My answer to that
            is that a mobile app allows for a better UI, especially because the web CP has so much information. A web browser has limited
            functionalities that would not allow for future AR and WebEx integrations and filtered home page. <br><br> --->

            Over time, I've reflected on this project a lot and had more thoughts about it. If I could go back and add/change things, I would:
            <br><br>
            <ul>
              <li> Be more creative with the interview questions. For example, instead of just asking how about general mobile usage,
                I would also ask what content the user likes to browse on their commute or in their down time. </li>
              <li> Create a user testing guide to see if the designs accomplished the goal of making resources more
              accessible. Success could be measured by click-through rates and time spent on each page. </li>
              <li> Bridge my co-intern's and my designs on a style guide to maintain visual consistency between us.</li>
              <li> Add a bottom navigation bar. Initially, I thought that a hamburger menu would suffice because the CP had so many pages
                and it made the universal search inexplicably clear.
                However, I realized that pressing on the hamburger menu would add an extra tap to open itself on top of tapping the page, whereas a bottom nav bar would
                only require the single tap to go to a page. Settings could be placed at the top right corner on the home page. Overall,
                the idea has a lot of friction and could have been designed differently.</li>
                <li> Rather than try to replicate the mobile-friendly features on the web portal, another way to pursue this project
                could have been to focus on mobile-exclusive features like AR and create a simple experience around that.  </li>
            </ul>
