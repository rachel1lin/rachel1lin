            <h4>Background (Why the Customer Portal is *chef’s kiss*)</h4>
            When I joined Cisco during Summer 2019, the Cisco Customer Experience Team was working on the Customer Portal (CP),
            an application that consolidates and organizes Cisco product resources for clients. In the past, clients have struggled
            in using Cisco’s antiquated search function to troubleshoot problems, and opening a support case to get questions
            answered can be costly and inefficient. The CP provides a step-by-step repository of resources (i.e. PDFs, webinars,
            license training, etc.) for all of Cisco’s products. Its largest value prop is that it allows clients to proactively
            prevent problems instead of retroactively scrambling to fix them.

            <h4>Research</h4>


            I, along with members of the CX team, flew down to San Diego to attend the Cisco Live!
            conference and conducted user research with Cisco clients. Our main target audience was
            network engineers, who benefit the most from the CP and use the CP directly. To start off
            our research, I co-wrote high-level questions and then based the rest of the interview guide
            off of them.

            Here are the three main insights that would influence my design decisions.
            <div class ="insights">

              <div><img src="insight3.png" alt="Old way of troubleshooting/searching"></img></div>
            </div>

            <br>

            With the insights from our research coupled with our given task, I devised this problem statement to focus our solutions.
            <br>

                How might we expand our current web platform to mobile so we can improve network engineers' accessibility to the CP?
              </div>
            </div>
            <br><br>

            <h4>Planning</h4>
            Part of my process to answering such vague questions is to brain-dump onto a piece of paper. I needed to
            restructure this vast CRM tool into a compact mobile app, so I first set out to lay out the barebones of the CP. I wrote
            out all the possible user flows and translated the navigation to be adapted to mobile. I also began some preliminary drawings
            for translating the web interactions into mobile interactions.

             <h6>Don't worry - I can't read it either </h6><br>
             <div class="case">
             There were a number of possible flows to explore. Instead of making all the screens possible, we divided our work up by
             features (I took Home Page and Lifecycle) and each crafted a user story that incorporated our research insights and
             communicated the value our designs brought to the user.


            <br><br>


            <h4>User Story </h4>

            This story is based off the problem statement above and showcases the different facets of accessibility I wanted to provide for the user: physically and within the app.

                (1) Ned is a network engineer whose company has acquired a new site, and he is responsible for setting up its network. He wants to do a thorough job and knows that the CP will allow him to take preventative measures and maintain a healthy network. So begins his user journey with the CP.

                (9, 10) I added on a AR functionality to the story that makes finding documentation for a product easier by scanning a barcode. This is a potential future AR project for Cisco.

            <h4> Solution #1</h4>
            <br>
            <b> Building a simple and omnipresent navigation and making search functions through it. </b> <br>
            Navigation allows the user to jump through multiple pages easily. I placed the search within the hamburger menu, so users can search universally instead of within each page. Next to the search button, the AR functionality follows the same principle of being available at the click of a button.

            <h4> Solution #2</h4>
            <br>
            <b> Creating a simple experience for browsing and scheduling resources. </b> <br>
            In order to have access to more relevant resources, I designed a “Suggested Resources” section underneath a video so users can further engage with more information and cascade through each page. Because Ned relies on watching the videos on his phone, I also built in a pop-up menu that allows him more interactions, such as, choosing a session for a webinar.

            <b>Collecting and consolidating highlights across all sections of the CP</b>
            <br>
            Using the second main insight from the research, I came up with a couple of ideas for how the home screen would look. Users expected a mobile app to be a simplified version of the web portal and wanted to have the most important information up front.

              </div>
            </div>

            <h2> Idea (3) </h2>

            <br>
            After the evolution of ideas, Idea (3) seemed to be the most effective for satsifying our users’ needs. Idea (3) was further iterated upon and developed after I left my summer internship.


            <br><br>
            <h4>Possible Next Steps</h4>
            <br>
            If I could continue on this project, I would want to create a user testing guide to see if the designs accomplished the goal of making resources more
            accessible. I would measure its success by high click-through rates and time spent on each page.<br>

            <br>
            <h4>Extra, Extra Notes</h4>
            <br>
            Our reasoning from the research initially led us to believe that mobile notifications were the most important feature
            that the mobile CP could provide. One of our stakeholders pointed out that users could simply get an email about any
            important updates. I realized that just because users expected notifications, it didn’t mean that notifications would
            definitely bring any value to the user. Thus, I reevaluated our research and focused on the use case that highlighted
            the portability and convenience of a mobile app.<br><br>

            Another designer asked us if the CP could simply be opened in a web browser rather than a mobile app. My answer to that
            is that a mobile app allows for a better UI, especially because the web CP has so much information. A web browser has limited
            functionalities that would not allow for future AR and WebEx integrations and filtered home page. <br><br><br>
